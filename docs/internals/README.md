# CipherSweet Internals

The purpose of this section is to aid the development of cross-platform
libraries that speak the same protocols as CipherSweet and to accelerate
third-party software security assessments.

* [Key Hierarchy](01-key-hierarchy.md) explains how each field gets its
  own encryption key, and how each blind index created on each field
  gets its own distinct key for calculating hashes.
